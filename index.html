        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class = about-me-info>I have worked with software for over 5 years in support, implementation and onboarding roles.
            I have recently started to learn coding and this is my site to highlight my portfolio of any projects I create.
            As I learn more code the site will update with new features to showcase my skills.
            In my spare time I play football and go to watch Newcastle United when I can, as well as winning my FPL League most years.
            I enjoy gaming both computers and board games, as well as reading various books. I live with Dylan and Harvey.
